New test repository

Hi there. I'm trying Github out for the first time. There's not much to see now. All comments found here are for myself. But come back again later. I'm working to get something running here.

I'm back again. This is a new branch called readme-edits. I'm going to commit changes... Now!

(So this isn't the original file. Line 6 wasn't there before. Now that I've merged the master and readme-edits, line 6 was inserted into master.) 

Try clicking preview changes. The green line on the left shows the changes you've made.

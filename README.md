# MY_NOTES
This is where I store all my notes. Most of the content here are from Panzerstadt. I have to keep them somewhere to give myself time to digest them before he bombards me with more info. 

## Markdown
This readme file is stored as Markdown. I gather that it's the improvement of HTML. You've gotta learn it to progress. Start remembering the codes so that you don't have to keep referring to the cheatsheet.

## Dashbaord
My first collaboration project with Panzerstadt - build a dashboard. Most of what we need will be in the notes here. I need to transition from learning to doing.
First step is to replicate this [gitnotes](http://gitnotes.herokuapp.com/). 
I'm going to need [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).

## Progressed.Io
This is a microservice for a progress bar.

## Steam Api
We're building a dashboard that includes gaming hours from Steam.
To do: Figure how to get the API.

## Pen
Learn to code animations with HTML. Do this at your own time.

Here's an animation of a cat on [LQ's Pen](https://codepen.io/panzerstadt/pen/gejzGV).
Try it yourself on your own page.
